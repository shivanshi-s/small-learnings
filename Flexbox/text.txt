space-around : equal amt to left n right side
space-between : space in between and corners are taken
space-evenly : even spaces in between (not much different that space around but google)

center : center inside of a container with Justify-content : center; 

single item : align-self : flex-start;

Flex direction column

flex:wrap; -> wraps within the width

flex grow, shrink, basis
flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis ; 
flex: 1          1           0 ;

Flex-basis -> setting the base width of the element , if less then width, then shrink
flex-grow -> how much extra space should be distributed to the items and grow with the width 
flex-shrink -> default = 1 ;
